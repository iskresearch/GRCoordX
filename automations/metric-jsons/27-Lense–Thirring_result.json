  "description": "The Lense-Thirring metric describes the spacetime around a rotating mass. It was developed by Josef Lense and Hans Thirring to model the gravitational effects of a rotating black hole. The metric is used in general relativity to study the spacetime around a rotating mass and has implications for our understanding of black holes and gravity.",
