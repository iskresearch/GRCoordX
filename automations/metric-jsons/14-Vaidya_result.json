    "description": "The Vaidya metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations, representing a spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime. It was first proposed by P. C. Vaidya in 1951. The metric is used to describe the gravitational field of a massive object, such as a star, in the context of general-relativity.",
